# CNNSudokuSolver
 A sudoku solver using a convolutional neural network
 The idea for this project was inspired by Shiva Verma:
 https://towardsdatascience.com/solving-sudoku-with-convolution-neural-network-keras-655ba4be3b11

 The repository contains the following:

 - Sudoku.Model: the prototype neural network
 - Sudoku2.Model: the final convolutional neural network
 - SudokuAI: the code for creating both neural networks
 - SudokuSolver: the code for the solver that uses the neural network.

 The "main method" of the solver lies in the SudokuSolver notebook; the method is called "temporaryUI" (at the bottom of
  the notebook). Running this method runs the solver.

 For how to run the method, see the comments provided inside SudokuSolver.
